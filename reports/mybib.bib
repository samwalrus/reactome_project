Network motifs are defined as over-represented small connected subgraphs in networks and they have been used for many biological applications. Since network motif discovery involves computationally challenging processes, previous algorithms have focused on computational efficiency. However, we believe that the biological quality of network motifs is also very important.

ROC curves are frequently summarized in a single scalar, the area under the curve (AUC). This article discusses the caveats and pitfalls of ROC analysis in clinical microarray research, particularly in relation to (i) the interpretation of AUC (especially a value close to 0.5); (ii) model comparisons based on AUC; (iii) the differences between ranking and classification; (iv) effects due to multiple hypotheses testing; (v) the importance of confidence intervals for AUC; and (vi) the choice of the appropriate performance metric. With a discussion of illustrative examples and concrete real-world studies, this article highlights critical misconceptions that can profoundly impact the conclusions about the observed performance.},

	abstract = {Finding disease markers (classifiers) from gene expression data by machine learning algorithms is characterized by a high risk of overfitting the data due the abundance of attributes (simultaneously measured gene expression values) and shortage of available examples (observations). To avoid this pitfall and achieve predictor robustness, state-of-the-art approaches construct complex classifiers that combine relatively weak contributions of up to thousands of genes (attributes) to classify a disease. The complexity of such classifiers limits their transparency and consequently the biological insights they can provide. The goal of this study is to apply to this domain the methodology of constructing simple yet robust logic-based classifiers amenable to direct expert interpretation. On two well-known, publicly available gene expression classification problems, the paper shows the feasibility of this approach, employing a recently developed subgroup discovery methodology. Some of the discovered classifiers allow for novel biological interpretations.},

Yeast Systems Biology: Methods and Protocols presents an up-to-date view of the optimal characteristics of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eukaryote, perspective on the latest experimental and computational techniques for systems biology studies, most of which were first designed for and validated in yeast, and selected examples of yeast systems biology studies and their applications in biotechnology and medicine. These experiments under controlled conditions can uncover the complexity and interplay of biological networks with their dynamics, basic principles of internal organization, and balanced orchestrated functions between organelles in direct interaction with the environment as well as the characterization of short and long-term effects of perturbations and dysregulation of networks that may illuminate the origin of complex human diseases. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular BiologyTM series, this volume contains the kind of detailed description and implementation advice that is crucial for getting optimal results. Practical and cutting-edge, Yeast Systems Biology: Methods and Protocols serves researchers interested in comprehensive systems biology strategies in well-defined model systems with specific objectives as well as a better knowledge of the latest post-genomic strategies at all ‘omic levels and computational approaches towards analysis, integration, and modeling of biological systems, from single-celled organisms to higher eukaryotes.},

IMPROVER is built on challenges posed to the community that draws on the wisdom of crowds to assess the most suitable methods for a given research task. The Diagnostic Signature Challenge, open to the public from Mar. 5 to Jun. 21, 2012, was the first instantiation of the IMPROVER methodology and evaluated a fundamental biological question, specifically, if there is sufficient information in gene expression data to diagnose diseases. Fifty-four teams used publically available data to develop prediction models in four disease areas: multiple sclerosis, lung cancer, psoriasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The predictions were scored against unpublished, blinded data provided by the organizers, and the results, including methods of the top performers, presented at a conference in Boston on Oct. 2–3, 2012. This paper offers an overview of the Diagnostic Signature Challenge and the accompanying symposium, and is the first article in a special issue of Systems Biomedicine, providing focused reviews of the submitted methods and general conclusions from the challenge. Overall, it was observed that optimal method choice and performance appeared largely dependent on endpoint, and results indicate the psoriasis and lung cancer subtypes sub-challenges were more accurately predicted, while the remaining classification tasks were much more challenging. Though no one approach was superior for every sub-challenge, there were methods, like linear discriminant analysis, that were found to perform consistently well in all.},

Initial studies into the predictive performance of set-level classifiers have yielded rather controversial results. The goal of this study is to provide a more conclusive evaluation by testing various components of the set-level framework within a large collection of machine learning experiments.

In this paper, we build on our research to provide a methodology overview of Boolean modeling in systems biology, including Boolean dynamic modeling of cellular networks, attractor analysis of Boolean dynamic models, as well as inferring biological regulatory mechanisms from high-throughput data using Boolean models. We finally demonstrate how Boolean models can be applied to perform the structural analysis of cellular networks.

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},
